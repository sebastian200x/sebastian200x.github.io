                    <p>On February 06, 1958, an association of civic-minded Chinese-Filipino businessmen of Malabon
                        founded the Philippine Malabon Chinese School. Spearheaded by Mr. Co San, the first Chairman of
                        the Board of Trustees, the school offered a complete Elementary Course with two sections for
                        each grade levels. On March 10, 1961, the Kindergarten building was constructed upon the
                        generosity of two donors, namely, Mr. Ke Eng Chay and Mr. Lim Gui Lui. Subsequently,
                        Kindergarten classes were offered.

                        On May 10, 1964, Mr. Lim Se Keng financed the extension of the main building to house more than
                        800 students. In 1973, the school was reconstituted and renamed the Philippine Malabon Cultural
                        Institute in compliance with the filipinization of all Chinese schools in the country. In
                        January 1985, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Mr. Samuel Malapas, financed the
                        construction of another building with 3 additional classrooms which was later used as TLE and
                        Science laboratory, and Scout office.

                        In February 1989, the Board of Trustees, headed by Chairman Mr. Charlie Ang, started a fund
                        raising initiative for the construction of the school auditorium. The dream to establish a high
                        school department was realized in 1997 with the support and encouragement of the Chairman of the
                        Board of Trustees Mr. Manuel Chua Co Kiong and Mrs. Consuelo Robles. In 2007, the Chairman of
                        the Board of Trustees, Mrs. Amparo Policarpio, donated the fund to construct a Parentâ€™s waiting
                        shed.

                        <br><br>

                        After the 50th year celebration of the institution, the Board of Trustees started a fund raising
                        activity to open a road leading to C4 road for easy access to the school grounds. On March 16,
                        2021, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Mr. Jason Choa, led the groundbreaking ceremony of
                        the new PMCI school building. Today, the Philippine Malabon Cultural Institute continues its
                        mission to nurture in the students the core values of excellence, integrity, respect, compassion
                        and social responsibility.

                        Filipino, English and Mandarin. Its present challenge is to expand this mission and realize its
                        vision of providing quality education to all its students, with experience drawn from more than
                        60 years of educating the youth.
