                    <h1>PMCI</h1>
                    <P>The Philippine Malabon Cultural Institute, founded in 1958 by civic-minded Chinese-Filipino
                        businessmen, initially provided elementary education under Mr. Co San's leadership. Generous
                        contributions led to expansions, including a kindergarten building in 1961 and extension of the
                        main building in 1964, accommodating over 800 students. Reconstituted in 1973 as PMCI, it
                        aligned with national directives. Visionary leaders like Mr. Malapas and Mr. Ang oversaw further
                        expansions, including an auditorium and high school department. Chairman Mr. Jason Choa
                        initiated a new school building in 2021, continuing PMCI's 60-year commitment to excellence and
                        bilingual proficiency.</P>
